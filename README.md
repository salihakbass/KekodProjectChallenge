## Main Screen when Ego Switch Open and Close
When we come to this screen, we are greeted by 6 switches. Initially, the Ego Switch is off, and the Lottie Animation adjusts accordingly. When the Ego Switch is on, the remaining switches become interactable. Once we turn on the Ego Switch, we can interact with the other switches. For each switch that the user turns on, a text and icon related to that switch are added to the 
Bottom Navigation and navigation to the corresponding pages can be done via the Bottom Navigation.

## Guess the Word Game Screen
When we come to this screen, we are greeted by a word guessing game. In this game, which contains a limited number of words related to Android Development, we try to guess the word based on the first letter. If the user makes an incorrect guess, another letter appears on the screen. The more letters are hidden when the user correctly guesses the word, the more points they earn.

## Guess the Random Number Game Screen
On this screen, we try to guess a random number generated by the system between 1 and 50. We display whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the system’s number using a Lottie Animation. The user has a total of 5 attempts, and a Lottie Animation appears on the screen based on whether they win or lose.
