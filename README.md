# Kekod Project Challenge
This project has been designed by Gökhan Öztürk for the purpose of helping students in the KeKoD community to develop themselves.

## Splash Screen
When we come to this screen, we are greeted by 6 switches. Initially, the Ego Switch is off, and the Lottie Animation adjusts accordingly. When the Ego Switch is on, the remaining switches become interactable. Once we turn on the Ego Switch, we can interact with the other switches. For each switch that the user turns on, a text and icon related to that switch are added to the 
Bottom Navigation and navigation to the corresponding pages can be done via the Bottom Navigation.
